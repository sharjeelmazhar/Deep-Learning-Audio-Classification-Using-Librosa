# Introduction:

This repo is a Deep Learning Audio Classification using [Librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html).  In this repo the user will learn to how to classify and predict data using deep learning Model. These model include RNN, LSTM and GRU.

The user will learn how to visualize results using TensorFlow(Tensor-board)  on local network and [WANDB](https://wandb.ai/site) as well. 

# Installment Guide:

## Required Tools:

In order to run this reop you need to have a couple program that are need to installed on your system such as 

1. Python
2. Anaconda Environment.
3. Visual Studio Code.
4. Jupyter Notebook.

These are the tools which are required for the learning process but there are a couple of important libraries are needed for the Deep Learn Model to work these libraries are stated bellow:

## Required Libraries:

1. TensorFlow
2. Librosa 
3. WanDb
4. JASON
5. Maths
6. OS
7. Sklearn
8. time
